# How to run each files
- clone
- open command prompt/git bash/anything similar
- type "node [filename]". eg: node question1.js, node question2.js, node question3.js
- the readline will ask you to give the input (restrict it by the rules that is mentioned in question description, i dont put any strict validation.

note: for question 1, it won't show as you asked on the description, the large amount of number will be converted by auto scientific notation format. I hope that would be no problem, since i was thinking if you wanted me to do that kind of conversion, you'll ask me right away rather than giving that factorial question and having also conversion to make it nice which is rather required more effort.

question1.js (estimation working time around 5 mins)
question2.js (estimation working time around 1 hours)
question3.js (this one especially cost me alot of time, started after lunch and just finish at 7)
